# RandomMatrix

This is code mainly used to simulate distance and inverse distance matrices as a attempt 
to tackle the spectral properties of these highly correlated random matrices.

Components are

RandomMatrix: simulation kernel for distance and inverse distance matrices.

in addition to this a number of Jupyter notebooks are added to illustrate the 
properties of these matrices. 

The work here is mainly mathematical with no intention of an appliaction to machine 
learning.
